# MTGRuleBook

A Simple Wiki to search for rulings about game mechanics. In this iteration, I have descriptions for some of the phases and how they work.

By clicking on one of the links for the phase, you can be taken to a more detailed paged with the option to go back to the home page to navigate to other areas.

If someone who uses the app wishes to have a pdf of all the details, they are able to at the bottom of the page.


Not all of the details are included in the app as of now. However, after the turn mechanics are completed, I plan to include more mechanics that players and users can search for and learn more about.
